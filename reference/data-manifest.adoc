= Data Manifest Specification

This document describes the format of data manifests.

Data manifests are written as YAML files.  Only the JSON-compatible semantics of YAML are used, so in the future they
may be representable in formats such as JSON or TOML.

== Overall Layout

A manifest file represents either a list or a map.

If it is a map and contains at least one of the keys `file` or `type`, then the map is taken to describe a single data file (see below).

Otherwise, the file describes a collection of data files.  If it is a map, then those files are labelled with their map keys; otherwise, they are labeled with their positions (starting from 0).

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
ratings:
  file: "ratings.csv"
  format: csv
  entity: rating
  header: true
items:
  file: "items.csv"
  entity: movie
  header: true
  columns:
    movieId: id
    title: name
----

defines a data source consisting of ratings data, read from `ratings.csv`, and movie titles read from `items.csv`.  The files have labels.  The same manifest can be written with numeric labels as follows:

```yaml
- file: "ratings.csv"
  format: csv
  entity: rating
  header: true
- file: "items.csv"
  entity: movie
  header: true
  columns:
    movieId: id
    title: name
```

== Data Source Description

Individual data sources are described with the following schema.

`type`::
The data source type.  Currently only `textfile` is supported.
+
The default source type is `textfile`.

The remainder of the keys are defined by the particular data source.

=== `textfile` data sources

`textfile` sources read data from text files, with one entity per line.  A text file may have one or more lines of header data.

`file`::
the file to read.

`format`::
The file format.  Can be one of:
	 - `delimited` — delimited, columnar text (default delimiter is `\t`)
	 - `csv` — `delimited` with a delimiter of `,`
	 - `tsv` — tab-separated (`delimited` with delimiter of `\t`)

`delimiter`::
The delimiter string for files with the `delimited` format.

`entity_type`::
The name of the entity type contained in this file.  The entity type is also used to provide defaults for the columns.  The default is `rating`.

`builder`::
The entity builder to be used for these entities.  The entity type may provide a default; otherwise, `org.lenskit.data.entities.BasicEntityBuilder` is used.  The keyword `basic` can be used to refer to the basic entity builder, to override a default entity builder if desired.

`header`::
Whether the file has a header.  If `true`, the file has a single-line header; if `false`, no header is assumed.  If an integer, it is the number of header lines.  The default is `false`.

`columns`::
A list describing the columns in the file (for columnar formats). A column descriptor can be either a string, giving a column name, or a map with keys `name` (the column name) and `type` (the column type, see [attribute data types](#data-types)).
+
If `header` is `true`, then this can be a map whose keys are column header labels and whose values are column descriptors.
+
If the `id` column is *not* specified, then entity IDs are synthesized from the line numbers in the file.

`indexes`::
A list of attribute names to be indexed for fast lookup.  If no indexes are specified, `item` and `user` if they are present on the entities.

`meta`::
Metadata about the data, such as the `domain` for rating values.`  Some of the common metadata:

    `domain`:::
	The valid range of rating values.  A map with the keys `minimum`, `maximum`, and `precision`; for example, 0.5-5 star data with 1/2 star precision would be described as follows:
+
```yaml
meta:
  domain:
    minimum: 0.5
    maximum: 5
    precision: 0.5
```

== Attribute Data Types

The following types are supported for attributes:

`int` or `Integer`::
Java `integer`.

`long` or `Long`::
Java `long`.

`double`, `real`, or `Double`::
Java `double`.

`string` or `String`::
Java `String`.

Java class name::
The corresponding class.  Must be convertible with http://www.joda.org/joda-convert/[Joda-Convert].

The entity type may provide default types for various attribute names, in addition to providing a default set of columns if `columns` is missing entirely.  If no default is available and the type is not specified, attributes are assumed to be strings.
