= Running Train-Test Evaluations

Once you have your link:gradle.adoc[script configured] and have link:data.adoc[prepared some data], you
can actually run a LensKit evaluation over it.  The train-test evaluator takes a set of train-test
splits, usually produced by the crossfolder, and runs a set of algorithms over them.

Evaluations are controlled by the link:https://mooc.lenskit.org/gradle-docs/index.html?org/lenskit/gradle/TrainTest[TrainTest] Gradle task; you can configure it like so:

[source,groovy]
.....
/* Run the LensKit evaluation */
task evaluate(type: TrainTest, group: 'evaluate') {
    description 'Runs the LensKit evaluation.'

    dataSet crossfold

    outputFile "$buildDir/eval-results.csv"
    userOutputFile "$buildDir/eval-users.csv"

    algorithm 'PersMean', 'algorithms/pers-mean.groovy'
    algorithm 'ItemItem', 'algorithms/item-item.groovy'
    algorithm 'Custom', 'algorithms/custom.groovy'

    predict {
        outputFile "$buildDir/predictions.csv.gz"
        metric 'rmse'
        metric 'ndcg'
    }
    recommend {
        listSize 10
        metric 'mrr'
    }
}
.....

== Input Data

The input data sets for the evaluation are specified using `dataSet` directives.  The common way
to do this is by mentioning the link:data.adoc#crossfold[Crossfold] task as a `dataSet`; this
automatically configures the evaluation to run on the train-test pairs produced by the crossfold
task, and enrolls the crossfold task as a dependency for the train-test task so that Gradle will
make sure to run them in the correct order.

You can also specify manually-created train-test splits, using data manifests:

[source,groovy]
.....
dataSet {
    trainSource 'train.yml'
    testSource 'test.yml'
}
.....

== Output Files

The output files are specified by the following options:

`outputFile`::
The aggregate output file, with one row per combination of data set and algorithm.

`userOutputFile`::
Detailed user-level statistics, such as the RMSE for each test user.  If omitted, no such output is produced.

The evaluator can also output the predictions and recommendations generated; these options are discussed below.

== Algorithms

Algorithms are specified using the `algorithm` directive. The algorithms themselves are defined in
Groovy files, using the [configuration language](../../basics/configuration).  Each algorithm should
be named:

[source,groovy]
.....
algorithm 'PersMean', 'algorithms/pers-mean.groovy'
.....

If no name is specified, the name is derived from the file name.

Multiple algorithms can be defined in a single Groovy file by means of `algorithm` blocks.  If the
Groovy file contains no `algorithm` block, then the entire file defines a single algorithm;
otherwise, each algorithm block defines an algorithm.

This can be used to implement things like parameter sweeps.  For example, you could write the
following in a file `item-item-nbr-sweep.groovy`:

[source,groovy]
.....
for (n in [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100]) {
    algorithm("ItemItem") {
        bind ItemScorer to ItemItemScorer
        bind (BaselineScorer, ItemScorer) to UserMeanItemScorer
        bind (UserMeanBaseline, ItemScorer) to ItemMeanRatingItemScorer
        bind UserVectorNormalizer to BaselineSubtractingUserVectorNormalizer
        set NeighborhoodSize to n
        attributes["NNbrs"] = n
    }
}
.....

This will define 14 instances of the item-item collaborative filtering algorithm with different
neighborhood sizes.  You can then use it in your `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
.....
trainTest {
    /* ... options ... */
    // no name is needed when using algorithm blocks
    algorithm 'item-item-nbr-sweep.groovy'
    /* ... more options ... */
}
.....

The `attributes` map contains _attributes_ for each algorithm.  Attributes are included as columns
in the evaluator's output files and can be used to distinguish different configurations when
analyzing the output.  This setup is good for plotting the recommender's performance as a function
of the neighborhood size.

== Tasks and Metrics

In addition to algorithms and input data, the evaluator needs to know what to measure.  This is
handled by _evaluation tasks_, each of which can have _metrics_.  The two tasks currently supported
are _predict_, which attempts to predict the ratings in the test set(s), and _recommend_, which
produces recommendations for each test user and compares them against their test ratings.

It usually only makes sense to have one predict task in an evaluation, but multiple recommend tasks
can be used to measure the output of recommendations produced with different settings for the list
length, candidate items, etc.

Each task supports an `outputFile` option that specifies an output file for the raw output
(recommendations or predictions).  The `metric` directive adds a metric to the task.

=== Predict

The predict task has no additional options other than its [metrics](../metrics/#predict).

=== Recommend

The recommend task, in addition to [metrics](../metrics/#topn), supports some further options:

`listSize`::
The length of recommendation lists to compute.  Specify -1 to compute unlimited-length lists.

`prefix`::
A prefix to apply to the column headers for the measurements taken in this task.  Useful so that
you can apply the same measurements to different recommendation lists.

`candidates`::
The set of items to use as candidate items for recommendation.  Defaults to `allItems`.

`exclude`::
A set of items to exclude from recommendation.  Defaults to `null`, using the default exclude
set for the configured recommender; this is typically equivalent to `user.trainItems`, but may
be different for custom `ItemRecommender` implementations.

See link:/apidocs/org/lenskit/api/ItemRecommender.html#recommend-long-int-java.util.Set-java.util.Set-[ItemRecommender#recommend(long,int,Set,Set)] for more details on the relationship
between the candidate and exclude sets.

Each of the sets is specified as a Groovy expression evaluated in the context of an link:/apidocs/org/lenskit/eval/traintest/recommend/ItemSelector.ItemSelectScript.html[item select
script].  The expression has access to information about the tested user as `user`, the
set of all item IDs as `allItems`, and some additional helper methods.  Expressions can be used
to write a variety of interesting selectors; for example, to recommend from the user's test items
plus 100 random decoys, use a `candidateItems` expression of:

[source,groovy]
.....
user.testItems + pickRandom(allItems - user.trainItems, 100)
.....
